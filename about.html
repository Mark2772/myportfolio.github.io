        <p>Hi! I'm Mark Jefferson L. Gocotano. From 2019 to 2021, I was deeply involved in the FiveM community, developing and managing custom servers. I also enjoyed being part of my school's Ideas team as a video editor, where I got to work on some cool multimedia projects. When I'm not coding or editing, you can find me playing Valorant with my school team, where I love strategizing and competing with friends.
